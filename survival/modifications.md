## Things listed in this channel are modifications added by me to the **Survival** gamemode:
- 1.8 PVP (offhand is still here)
- Buying and selling:
 * Things can be sold through `/sell` and bought through `/buy`
- The upgrade system:
 * The upgrade menu can be accessed through `/upgrade`. Armor upgrades apply to the piece of armor **being worn**. It does **NOT** apply to what you are holding. Tool upgrades **DO** apply to what's being held in the main hand.
 * The upgrade menu applies ALL upgrades found in the upgrades file!
- __Bottles O' Enchanting are no longer throwable__, instead they are just immediately used, and provide **100XP** (around **one** level at level **30**), significantly more than their original average of **7XP**. They are in the shop for $750.
- Renaming items in an anvil without combining or repairing is **always** 1 level
- Anvil is 25% cheaper
- The Brush can be used to make item frames invisible (item frames cannot be invisible on Bedrock Edition)
